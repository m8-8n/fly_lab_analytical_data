# fly_lab_analytical_data
This code is able to organize the sleep fly data with RStudio

The data must primarily be organized with DAMFile Software 
Secondly, it must be developed into a readable table with column titles: fly (fly number will be put here), genotype, sex, date of eclosion, and the hours of activity relabled from 1-24 to 0-23. 

The code can produce sleep trends, produce graphs with and without error bars, calculate the number of subjects in the data set, and combine genotypes into one graph to compare sleep trends.
